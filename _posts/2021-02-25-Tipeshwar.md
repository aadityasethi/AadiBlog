My family has been going on trips in past in winters, but this time as my  sister had her exams, hence Dad and Son outing was decided… for a trip to a wildlife sanctuary. Visit to Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, which is in Yavatmal district of Maharashtra, was a dream come true.

***First Break***

My dad and I travelled with iCampers , a group which conducts  wildlife tours , led by Kedar Kulkarni uncle . on 11th Feb night we travelled from Pune to Mumbai. From there took an early morning flight - an hour journey – to Nagpur . We reached Nagpur by 7 am. There was still 3 hour journey to be undertaken to reach Tipeshwar. We reached our beautiful stay home,  “Anant heritage” , by 11 am,  and rested , had our lunch and started for our 1st safari.

***What Tipeshwar Looks Like***

We were a group of 14 people from Mumbai and Pune. Five of us stayed in the dormitory. Apart from my dad and I , Abhijeet uncle, Kedar uncle, Sandeep uncle were there.  
If you want to spot a tiger, Tipeshwar is just the place for you. It has 3 gates, and we used the Sunna gate. It is a hide and seek experience. In which you are to seek the majestic beast of the jungle. You have to become Sherlock Holmes, gathering clues , waiting for the right moves, silently hearing the jungle sounds and spotting the Tiger. There will be clues like where last a Tiger has been spotted, the pug marks and of-course the calls by the animals.

There were 4 safaris in total, 2 at noon 2:30-6:30 pm and 2 in morning 6:30-10:30 am. Me, my Dad , Abhijeet uncle and Reshma aunty were in the jeep for all four safaris. We all carried cameras.. yess, me too. 

In the first safari we were in one place for 3 HOURS! …waiting at a water hole, without luck,  and when we left, the people who waited for a few minutes more, spotted the Tiger. We knew we were close but not close enough. But we saw Plum Headed Parakeet, White Eyed Buzzard and Spotted deer.

For second safari the next day (13th) , we woke up at 4 am, had quick tea with biscuits and rushed to the Sunna gate. When we reached the gate was still closed. We joked that the gate is not  closed for the tiger and it may be watching us. When the gate opened we were the 2nd to get the jeep. We had our lucky charm -Spicy banana chips- brought by Reshma aunty, and moved on Shikar road, and yes luck struck, we saw an Indian Wolf just  ahead of us and looking straight towards us. When we were going towards the Talaab we saw fresh Tiger pug marks, they were over the tyre marks we had made just 5 minutes ago. We were sooo close. We waited… went to all the places the guide thought the tiger could possibly be. An hour went by and still we had no luck. Then we saw a Langoor,  it was so cute that we couldn’t help but started capturing beautiful memories. I am 100% sure you won’t believe what happened next. A TIGER WITH CUBS HAD JUST CROSSED WHERE OUR JEEP  WAS, AND WE MISSED IT!! A few people saw it, We knew we were close and were hopeful that we will spot a tiger in  our next safari. But we spotted Crested Serpent Eagle, White Eyed Buzzard, Bharadwaj, Rufos Treepie, Deer.

In the 3rd safari at 2:30 pm we were ready to spot a tiger. We SPOTTED………A……. Indian Hoopoe. You thought I was going to say tiger. Well..well we also saw a troop of Langoor , with cute babies eating wood apple (Bel).  We also saw Black Stork, Adjutant Stork,  Shikra, Bayback Shrika, Long Tailed Shrike, ShortToed Snake Eagle, Rufous Treepie, Indian cormorant and common kingfisher.

All hopes were on our 4th and last safari. Wait… did I tell you that in the third safari the path from which we crossed a tiger was spotted there just after we left. WHY ARE WE ONLY CLOSE AND NOT THE ONES WHO SPOT  THE TIGER. Anyways, onto the 4th safari, we stayed put in one place where the Tigress , Palikhan with 5 month old cubs, was spotted. We were very lucky to spot 2 Jungle Cats on that path, they are very shy and extremely difficult to spot. They were there till a noisy crowd of people came and the Jungle Cats dashed away. We happened to be the only ones who had spotted them. We heard people saying that the tiger has killed a Wild Boar but nobody saw the kill. While we were going back we heard the Tiger roar but it was too late. I really did not want to leave Tipeshwar but we had to.  

I know you also want to keep reading and your heart will be feeling desperate to visit Tipeshwar. I definitely want more such adventures and I know so would you. 

 _ps - I would like to tell you the places where the tiger can be spotted. There is Shikaar road. The Palikhan road and the Taalab_
